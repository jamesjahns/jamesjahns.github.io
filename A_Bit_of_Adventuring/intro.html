                You have reached the temple of legends, whose mysterious runes (which come in two varieties) and strange riddles have stumped many an adventurer.
                Little is known about the constructors of this temple (although we know they couldn't count past 7),
                but its inner workings have remained a mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
                You come equipped with 9 <b>Runic Rings</b>, whose powers are surely essential to besting this temple.
                The rings are simple circles, smaller than the runes within the temple.
                However, it is said that these rings can drastically change the effects of the runes when applied to them, and are essential to the temple's inner workings.
            </p>
            <p>
                ...Oh, uh, you forgot those at home. Oh well; perhaps today you can simply inspect the temple grounds,
                in the hopes of knowing what to do when you bring the rings next time.
            </p>
            <p>
                You brace yourself and enter the temple's labyrinthine halls.

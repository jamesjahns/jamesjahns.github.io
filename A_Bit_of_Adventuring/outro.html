                After investigating this place's many rooms, you seem to be catching on to the the inner workings of this temple.
                While it's a shame you don't have your Runic Rings with you, you're pretty sure that if you had placed the nine of them in just the right place,

                Truly, this temple is an engineering marvel - there seems to be a powerful magic within its walls. If you could harness this magic, there's no telling how the world would change...

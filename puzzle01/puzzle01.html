        <h1>Obituaries</h1>
        <p>Everyone remembers great men for different reasons, 
            as these obituaries prove…

            <h2 class="title">?⑩???? ??????</h2>
            <img src="pic01.png"/>
            <p>A large number of people know him as a leading member of a prestigious juggling community,
                as well as a member of professional trampoline group "The <b>???④????   ?????</b>".</p>

            <h2 class="title">??????⑦-????? ①?????</h2>
            <p>He started his career in the sewers of Paris,
                but was not swayed by the July Revolution’s revolt against French inequality,
                and so he was exiled from his home country. He ended up as a mere tutor of the Duke of <b>??????③?</b>.</p>

        <div class="torn A">
            <h2 class="title">⑧. ?. ?????</h2>
            <img src="pic03.png"/>
            <p>He had a strong passion for cricket, and
                —I apologize to him for revealing this—
                was allegedly unable to bear his own reflection,
                choosing to cover his hotel mirrors with <b>??⑨???</b>.</p>
            
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
        <div class="torn B">
            <h2 class="title">???? ?????⑪</h2>
            <p>Rumor has it that he dabbled in alchemy and necromancy.
                He once used his (alleged) familiar spirit, a black <b>????⑤??</b>, to catch a thief.
                While we don't have much to log about this man, he nonetheless holds a place in our hearts.</p>

        <div class="torn A">
            <h2 class="title">???? ????⑬</h2>
            <img src="pic05.png"/>
            <p>He was a rather discreet person, living most of his life out of a suitcase,
                expecting his hosts to provide him everything from food to laundry.
                He called God a fascist because He kept hiding his glasses.
                We’ll end with the epitaph he suggested for himself:
                “I’ve finally stopped getting <b>??⑫???</b>”.</p>

            <h2 class="title">?????? ????⑥????</h2>
            <p>Admittedly, this man was a couple steps away from functional.
                He would sometimes go entire days eating or drinking nothing but milk.
                He once replaced most his furniture with granite rocks.
                For no obvious reason, he would sign his letters with the initials <b>?.②.?.?.</b> after his name.</p>
